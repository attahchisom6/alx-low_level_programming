# **FUNCTION POINTERS**


_Function pointers are **POINTERS** that point to functions
Note that rhis is very different to the concept of a function that returns a pointer to a data in the sense that
1. the former return the address of a function or returns nothing (void) it also holds in memory the first byte of the function
whjle the later return the adress of a data type e.g int

2. The former holds the code of the function (the first byte of code of the function to be specific) while the latter holds the adress of the data or the address of the first element of the data, if it is an array
